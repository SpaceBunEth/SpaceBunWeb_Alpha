# SpaceBunWeb_Alpha
The Alpha version of a static simple website in the theme of spacebun, basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript

## To-Do
1. Change all image urls to point to github file location
2. Get js functioning correctly *ie* change urls to github urls, test run & trouble shoot <sub> if needed </sub>
3. clean up code(make code more readable) and add comments
4. Get API from coingecko working
5. Complete items on list before moving on to improving and developing new features.

### Note
If improvements can be made to the code, look, and feel of the spacebunweb_alpha. A fork might be made and a beta created/ developed with the intention of creating a IPFS webpage. All depends on development of SpaceBunWeb Alpha and technical limitations of the IPFS project. The vision is to host the IPFS files on a dedicated device like a Raspberry Pi to insure higher performance and faster load times. These concepts and tech are new to me, so it is unclear how things will turn out. It is undetermined what direction is needed to be taken to insure these goals are met. However, I am optimistic in my abilities to accomplish this goal.
